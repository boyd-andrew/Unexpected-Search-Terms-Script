This script identifies search terms from Google Ads campaigns that do not share any words with the keywords they were triggered by. It will pull this data for the previous month. It helps optimize campaigns by:
Highlighting irrelevant search terms to exclude as negative keywords.
Discovering new keywords to add for better targeting.

You can create a blank Google Sheet to plug into the script, it will do all of the formatting for you! 

If you want to keep the data/run on a monthly basis please make sure to download it. It will be overwritten the next time it runs!
